\begin_layout Title
Computational Economics Midterm 1 SFU 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\begin_layout Section
Rules of the Exam
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exam will be take-home and you have 1 week to deliver it.
 You can ask me questions but they must be clarification questions only,
 no hints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exam is individual.
 If I find two or more of you share the same the score will be divided by
 the number of people sharing the same answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have to deliver a pdf report with your LASTNAME_Name_midterm1.pdf containing
 a report of your findings and document all the steps you did for obtaining
 the solution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No late exams or submissions accepted.

\begin_layout Section
BLP Estimation (60% of the grade)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have provides a simulated dataset where you are asked to estimate BLP
 and report on the average elasticity of price.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the country of Wano there are 
\begin_inset Formula $T=200$
\end_inset

 markets, and there are 3 coffee makers, MD, TH and SB.
 Each of them produce their own differentiated product MD, TH and SB (for
 simplicity).
 The obseved characteristic is caffeine score, the only observed cost attribute
 is caffeine score.
 The firms chose prices in a monopolistic setup so there are two observable
 attributes for consumers price and caffeine score.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Tasks for the students:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Data Analysis: Transform the different datasets in the folder .../GitHub/SFUComputa
tionalEconomics2024/midterm1_BLP/simulated_data, into the format that is
 usable for the BLP estimation used in class.
 Document how you did it, and report in your pdf a screen shot of the first
 10 markets in the shape of the data of the code we used in class.
 Note that instruments are not included in this dataset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use the provided instruments in the simulated dataset to estimate BLP not
 the ones generated by the code used in class.
 Report the average price elasticity , the average caffeine score elasticity
 for demand, and report the cost elasticity of caffeine score.
 The readme.file has information on the value of the elasticities, due to
 sample variability your estimates could differ numerically from these but
 should be 
\series bold
reasonably close.
 Provide a nice table with the elasticities and a good interpretation of
 them.
 Remember that in your documentation of results you have to follow best
 practices https://chrisconlon.github.io/site/pyblp.pdf to choose optimizers
 and other tuning parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now use the instruments generated by the code and re-estimate BLP elasticities
 compare with the solution to the previous part, if your estimates differ
 explain why.
 This is an open question so no correct answer but to get full points you
 must provide a workable estimation using the original code.
 Remember that since the number of attributes is different you have to change
 things to make it work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Merger Simulation (40% of the grade) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulate the new equilibrium under the following scenarios and compare to
 the baseline model you just estimated: with new shares and prices when
 MD and TH merge into a single firm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Efficiency sceneario: the new caffeine score 
\begin_inset Formula $cs$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $MD+TH$
\end_inset

 coffee will be 
\begin_inset Formula $cs_{MDTH}=min(cs_{MD},cs_{TH})$
\end_inset

 and the new unobserved cost shifter will be also the min of the original
 firms/products.
 So marginal cost of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{MD}+TD$
\end_inset

 is lower than the originals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Average scenario: he new caffeine score 
\begin_inset Formula $cs$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $MD+TH$
\end_inset

 coffee will be 
\begin_inset Formula $cs_{MDTH}=\frac{1}{2}(cs_{MD}+cs_{TH})$
\end_inset

 and the new unobserved cost shifter will be also the average of the original
 firms/products.
 So marginal cost of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{MD}+TD$
\end_inset

 is in the middle of the original ones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you work on a regulatory institution would you approve the merger under
 Efficiency Sceneario? Would you approve it under the average scenario?
 Yes ,no and why?
