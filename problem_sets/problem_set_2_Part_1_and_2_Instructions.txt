## Part 1: Simulation with Metropolis-Hastings and Comparison

### Task
Simulate a normal (Gaussian) distribution using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, targeting a mean (μ) of 0 and variance (σ²) of 1.

### Approach
Implement the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm within the framework provided by the Elvis_simple.jl file. This involves:
- **Proposal Distribution**: Choosing an appropriate proposal distribution. For simulating a normal distribution, a common choice is another normal distribution with a mean of 0 but perhaps a different variance to ensure adequate exploration of the sample space.
- **Acceptance Criterion**: Define the acceptance criterion based on the ratio of the target distribution probabilities and the proposal distribution probabilities.
- **Iterations**: Run the algorithm for a sufficient number of iterations to ensure convergence to the target distribution.

### Plotting and Analysis
- After generating the data, plot it to visually inspect its normality.
- **Enhancement**: Include a Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot) against a standard normal distribution, which is a more rigorous way to visually check for normality.
- Compute and display key summary statistics (mean, variance) and overlay a standard normal curve for comparison.

### Comparison with `randn(.)`
- Compare the Metropolis-Hastings generated data with that from Julia's `randn(.)`.
- Use visual plots (histograms, Q-Q plots) and statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) for comparison.
- **Analytical Insight**: Discuss the efficiency and accuracy of the Metropolis-Hastings approach compared to the direct sampling method used in `randn(.)`.

### General Enhancement
- **Code Efficiency and Validation**: In implementing Metropolis-Hastings, ensure that your code is efficient, especially since this algorithm can be computationally intensive. Validate your results by testing the algorithm's performance on different proposal distributions or tuning parameters.
- **Theoretical Understanding**: Include a discussion on why Metropolis-Hastings is suitable (or not) for this task compared to direct sampling methods. This can touch upon topics like the efficiency of random walks in exploring the sample space and how well the algorithm converges to the target distribution.

By incorporating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, you not only simulate a normal distribution but also delve into the realm of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which are fundamental in statistical computing. This will provide a robust understanding of both the practical and theoretical aspects of distribution simulation.

## Part 2: Extension of `Elvis_simple.jl`

### Task
Modify the `Elvis_simple.jl` file to add a new moment condition:

```math
g_{new}(x,e) = w'p
```

such that:

```math
E[g_{new}(x,e)] = 0
```

This increases the number of moment conditions from 4 to 5.

### Technical Note
- Be cautious about array sizes and index references when modifying the number of conditions.
- Ensure that all parts of the code are updated to reflect this new condition.
- This may involve updating matrices or vectors that store or process these moments.

### Reporting and Testing
- Report the test statistic and interpret the hypothesis testing.

### Analysis
- Understand the hypothesis being tested, likely related to the goodness of fit or the validity of the model specification.
- Compute the test statistic accordingly.

### Critical Value
- The critical value will change due to the new degrees of freedom in your test.
- Use the correct distribution (likely a chi-squared distribution) with the new degree of freedom to find this value.

### Interpretation
- Interpret the results of the hypothesis test.
- Discuss how the addition of `g_{new}(x,e)` affects the model.
- Analyze whether this improves or weakens the model fit.

### General Advice
- **Documentation**: Ensure that your report is well-documented, explaining your steps, choices, and findings.
- **Code Efficiency**: In Julia, look for opportunities to use vectorization or in-built functions for optimization.
- **Validation**: Validate your results by checking assumptions and using alternative approaches where feasible.
